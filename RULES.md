Game Rules and Gameplay
1. General Gameplay
Players' Cards:

Each player is initially dealt 16 cards.
The cards are sorted according to their types (Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs) and values (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, ... 2).
The 20 cards remaining on the floor are dealt to the players in turn in the next phase.
Trump Determination:

The type of card played first by Player 1 is designated as trump (e.g. ‘Hearts’).
Game Cycle:

Players take turns playing cards and a winner is determined according to the rules.
When the first hand is over, the remaining cards are dealt to the players in turn and the game continues.
Winner:

The player with the most hands wins the game. If both players have an equal number of hands, the game ends in a draw.
2. Play according to the types of cards
Same Type Obligation:

If the first player plays a card of the same type, the other player must play a card of that type.
For example, if Player 1 played ‘4 Spades’, if Player 2 has a ‘Spade’ in his/her hand, he/she must play it.
Obligation to Play Trumps:

If the other player has no cards of the same suit, he must play a trump.
For example, if the trump is ‘Hearts’ and Player 2 has no ‘Spades’, he must play ‘Hearts’.
Other Cards:

If the player has neither a card of the same type nor a trump card, he may play any card of his choice.
3. Power Ranking of Cards
The value of the cards is as follows in the order of their rank:

Ace (A) > King (K) > Queen (Q) > Jack (J) > 10 > 9 > 8 ... > 2
For cards of the same type, the card with the higher value wins the hand.
Trump Power:

Any card of the trump type is more powerful than any other type.
4. Player Order and Scoring
At the end of each hand, the player who won the hand receives a point.
The new hand is started by the player who won the previous hand.
5. Second Card Deal
When the first 16 cards are finished, the remaining 20 cards are dealt to the players in turn:
1st Card → Player 1
2nd Card → Player 2 continues.
After the distribution is completed, the game continues with the same rules
